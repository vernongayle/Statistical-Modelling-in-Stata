This file provides an intensive 'fast-track' introduction to statistical
modelling in Stata.

The file is aimed at social science researchers.

Please be patient. Computers often go wrong.

No micro data will be distributed within this file.

The files required are provided in a repository.

Participants MAY NOT make copies of these files or distribute them.

The files have been sepcially created for training and MUST not be

THE DATA ARE NOT REAL! DO NOT USE THEM FOR REAL ANALYSES!

We advise that participants galvanise their training experience and
work with 'genuine' data files which they
can dowload legally from the UK Data Service (http://ukdataservice.ac.uk/ -

A few commands in this file write to your machine.

In face-to-face workshops this would be a memory stick.

For illustration the drive is called "F:\" .

You may need to change this location on your own computer.

In your work environment you will probably use a network location
such as your "M:\" drive.

When using Stata at you own university (or workplace) you will have to change 
this to the correct location.

This file was initially prepared using Stata 17.

Stata is continually being improved.

This means that programs and do-files written for older versions might 
stop working.

It is possible to specify the version of Stata that you are using at the 
top of programs and do-files .

e.g.  version 10

Some of the commands that are used in this file may NOT
run on small demo versions of Stata. 


********************************************************************************

We suggest that you make a copy of this file immediately.

		* IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS INFORMATION *
		* AND FOLLOW THE Stata.do FILE LINE BY LINE!     *
		**************************************************


The file is sequential. 

It MUST be run line by line. 

Many of the commands will NOT run if earlier lines of commands have not been 
executed.


Anotate your new copy of the file as you work through it with your own notes 
(use "*" to comment out your notes).

There are "Questions" for you to answer and "Exercises" for you to do.

SPSS users who are new to Stata might find the following page very helpful

Source â This is the source of variance, Model, Residual, and Total. 
The Total variance is partitioned into the variance which can be explained
by the independent variables (Model) and the variance which is not explained by
the independent variables (Residual, sometimes called Error). 
The Sums of Squares for the Model and Residual add up to the Total Variance, 
reflecting the fact that the Total Variance is partitioned into 
Model and Residual variance

Examining the "Total" Sum of Squares 
 
In this passage we will use Stata's scalar variables.
 
 
Stata scalar variables are different from variables in the dataset. 
Variables in the dataset are columns of observations in your data. 
Stata scalars are named entities that store single numbers or strings.
 
Remember 

The Total Sum of Squares (TSS) =

Sum (Y - Y_bar)^2

^2 is Stata notation for squared (i.e. to the power of 2)

/**

Installing Packages in Stata

A benefit of Stata is that new commands and functions are developed which can 
be incorporated into your current version of Stata. It is possible to acquire 
and manage downloads from the internet using the command net. 
The findit command can be used to search the Stata site and other sites for 
information. For example imagine that you heard about a program to draw graphs 
using quasi-variance estimates, then using the syntax findit qvgraph would lead 
you to the module written by Aspen Chen of the University of Connecticut. 

Many new packages are deposited at the Statistical Software Components (SSC) 
archive which is sometime called the Boston College Archive and is administered 
by http://repec.org . 

The SSC archive has become the premier Stata download site for user-written 
software and also archives proceedings of Stata Users Group meetings and 
conferences. Programmes can be downloaded from the SSC archive using the syntax
ssc install followed by the new programmeâs name. 

Participants who do not have administrative access to Stata 
(for example when working on their university network), may first require 
permission to download packages. 

An alternative approach may be to set up an area locally where you have write 
access (e.g. c:\temp ) and then use the following Stata syntax

	global path10 "c:\temp\"
	capture mkdir $path10\stata
	capture mkdir $path10\stata\ado
	adopath +  $path10\stata\ado
	net set ado $path10\stata\ado

You can test this by installing a package from SSC for example the estout 
package

ssc install estout

Help on this new package should then be available

		help estout
